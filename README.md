# CS-230-Software-Design Reflection 

Client Summary 
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web based, multi-platform application. The goal was to design software that could support multiple simultaneous games, teams, and players while remaining scalable, secure and efficient across desktop and mobile environments. This required careful planning around system architecture, memory and storage management, distributed networking, and overall platform compatibility. 

What I did Well
One area that I did particularly well was organizing the software design document and clearly explaining how each technical decision supported the client's needs. I was able to connect concepts such as design patterns, distributed systems, and platform selection into a structured recommendation that deomonstrated both technical understand and clear communication. 

What Helped When Developing Code
Working through the design document first helped me understand the system before writing code. Planning the architecture, memory usage, and storage approach made the coding process more efficient because I already knew how the components should interact. This showed me  how important software design and documentation are in real-world development. 

What I Would Revise 
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the depth of early architectural explanations and include more detailed diagrams or examples. Strengthening those early sections would make the final document even clearer and more professional for stakeholders and developers. 

Interpreting User Needs
I translated the client's needs such as multi-platform support, scalability, and real-time multiplayer interaction into technical design choices like a Linux cloud-based server, client-server architecture, centralized database storage, and secure network communication. Considering user needs is critical because software is ultimately build to solve real problems and create positive user experiences, not just demonstrate technical skill. 

My Approach to Software Design 
My design approach focused on breaking the system into components, evaluating platform options and selecting technologies that support scalability, security, and maintainability. In the future, I would continue using structured design documentation, architectural pattern analysis, and early planning of distributed systems to guide development of similar applications.
